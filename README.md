Embedded Video Email Code Sample Project

Files: video.html --starting html, easier to maintain

video-inlined.html --send-ready file via https://www.campaignmonitor.com/resources/tools/css-inliner/

Intent: While the majority of email clients still do not support playing video directly from your inbox, both Apple Mail and the native Samsung email client do - and both represent a large segment of the email client market. To cover all email clients, however, fall-back code is added providing alternative content. Here, an animated gif fall-back indicated a user should click through to see the video using their browser. To get started, I followed the Email on Acid guide here: https://www.emailonacid.com/blog/article/email-development/a_how_to_guide_to_embedding_html5_video_in_email/
